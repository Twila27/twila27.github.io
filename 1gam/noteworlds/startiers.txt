Titles for Design Star Tiers (note W1-W4 draw on the Winter_Triangle asterism + Alpha Centauri for reasons below == //magic circle shape)
  (Does not update until after you've completed that game's chapter.)
  - P: Betelgeuse, The Runaway Star (After Jerome, the expected supernova for this star paralleling your encounter with the Fallen)
  - W0: Vega, The Dwarf Star (After Tyko, noted dust ring as parallels the state of your design star shape following W0)
  - W1: Pleiades, The Seven Stars (After Worldbuilding, to reflect the tons of angles that go into conveying a sekai-kan worldsense)
  - W2: Procyon, The Binary Star (After Gameplay, it's got a tech joke but also signifies Oxenfree's dual why-and-what BossLens lesson)
  - W3: Alpha Centauri, The Closest Star (After Sonzai-kan, it's "third" brightest but also closest == most personal == characters!)
  - W4: Sirius, The Brightest Star (After All Normal Bosses)
    //Or, if we go nonlinear, could do https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuban for W4 (see historical significance) and then Sirius for whichever we complete last.
  - E: Polaris, The Guiding Star (After Epilogue, gained incrementally over the final battle)
  //(Wishlist: different asterisms captured by different FoeLens that you can equip for different effects on canvases/boosts/design star?)

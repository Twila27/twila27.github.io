    <h2>Gameplay System: Ideas</h2>
    <p>Started from the premise that Ideas are indeed a dime-a-dozen, but built-out worlds like the one you summon are not. 
      Therefore, an Idea here functions similar to coins and collectibles in other games, serving as ammo for your Designer's Star.
      <strong>Current rule: one Idea per untyped shot.</strong>
      The operative word here is "untyped," because you may freely use typed shots without consuming your reserves of Ideas -- after all, a typed shot is a new idea.
      This obviously then implies that, assuming the game has made you want to boost, the player will just hammer out short one-letter word ideas.
      To encourage longer words then, a short word does not get as big a boost as a full one.
      Thankfully, typing the same letter repeatedly takes more effort than different letters, though it's likely we'll get a lot of "asdf" and "asdfjkl;"...
      So I argue for looking to keep say the last 100 words used in typed shots, and negating (not zeroing, negating) the boost offered by any duplicates found (perhaps darkened out as you type them for feedback).
      The goal with typed replies (when not used to answer a FoeLens) == to be sending out a stream of thought bubble words, in this way motivating a player to inspire themselves by being a random thought generator.
      Importantly this can all be bypassed if the player explores the level and gathers more Ideas laying around for untyped shots, so we have <strong>a choice between exploration (though this may use boosts!) and typed shooting.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>Older description: Idea seeds come from the mindset that listening is what allows you to get your own ideas--nothing can come out without something being placed inside first! This however does NOT control your ability to summon your inner world--you don't need to listen in order to have that power. Rather, summoning your world results from use of the Star Petals--because that reflects focusing on your inner world by thinking about it as you write replies to the FoeLens. So idea seeds => petal use ammo => your petal abilities => summoning your inner world's magic circle.

  <h2>Implementation Ideas</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;* The more you add to your magic circle's world of replies to the Foelens, the more elements you have to choose in reply with during future encounters?</p>
  <h2>Unresolved Ideas</h2>
  <p>* Are the anthro concepts the intangible forms of the SoB cast?</p>
  <p>* Story/World/Plot Seeds as collectibles? Perhaps some kind of fuel for your avatar's abilities, and/or pushing around your affinities (if we could combine them with their more bottom-up parallels)?</p>
  <p>* Who it is that invites you towards and grants you the abilities you end up with -- little DT?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Wishlisted Ideas</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;* What abyss takes the presence of a threat in the face of your goal? -- also DT, but fully formed, showing you the flipside to all points on your designer's star. <em>(The addition of a surplus boss beyond the world-row-as-boss to showcase this concept with the message that design sometimes functions at its strongest when channeling both the positive and negative forms of the author's eye.)</em></p>

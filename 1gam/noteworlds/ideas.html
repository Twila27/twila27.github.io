  <div><h1>Ideas</h1>
  </div>
  
  <div><h2>Implementation Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The more you add to your magic circle's world of replies to the Foelens, the more elements you have to choose in reply with during future encounters?</li>
  </ul></div>
  
  <div><h2>Unresolved Ideas</h2>
  <p>Needs a tiny bit more thought: WHAT IF BOSSES EMBED THEIR CHALLENGES UPON YOU?
	<ul>
    <li>When entering their world?</li>
	  <li>When encountering them at the level's end?</li>
	  <li>Maybe it also saves off as discussed for the Dragon to scar it with your very first prompt that comes up when it attacks you?</li>
  </ul></div>
  
  <div><h2>Wishlisted Ideas</h2>
  <h3>Design Star: Rule Stretch Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can again hold down G+H when firing an execute action to scale a burst based on current Design Star rank, but inside a timing puzzle based on [hybrids of] the keyed seuqence abilities (go wild with UMG anims).</li>
    <li>Should a typed shot "miss," try to see if we can't copy it off to the clipboard to quickly recover and not lose a lot of work.</li>
    <li>Typing 'a' provides a smaller boost than 'asdf'?</li>
    <li>Have arrows pop up with the overlay (i.e. make the petal directions pulse along in their direction) to encourage player to explore their own overlay! Less need to teach the player strictly by text.</li>
    <li>Tyko's challenge should reward typed over untyped shots with bigger boosts, //if you abide by his guiding and at least explore (indifferent to what you write) and listen to each FoeLens--similar to the mechanic of Link's full-hearts sword beams, but here tying into the exploration aspect!</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h3>Design Star: Feel-Polish Stretch Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maybe increased use of the star-summoning can envelop the player avatar in more and more of their own world?</li>
    <li>Test starting the charge-up for EVERYTHING being on KeyDown -- and with a camera shake -- trigger the results on KeyUp. Ka-BOOM rhythm.</li>
    <li>This might even make the pacing of the switch to striking a direction feel better.</li>
    <li>The basic Jerome design star take a charge up for W0 but after Tyko no longer does. (Adds progression of mechanics.)</li>
    <li>Locking in the text brightens up the core of the magic circle as the text falls inside the given petal.<ul>
      <li>Makes it look more like the text is actually going into a petal before it gets fired out.</li>
      <li>Indicates better to the player that they need to return to G+H after typing into a prompt.</li></ul>
    <li>FYI that you can play untyped with one hand in the current setup (just not typed shots).</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h3>Unorganized</h3>
  <ul>	 
    <li>Sharing: ability to export canvases?</li>
    <li>Self-comparison: not hiding the canvases behind needing to talk to the seated lenses?</li>
    <li>What abyss takes the presence of a threat in the face of your goal? -- also DT, but fully formed, showing you the flipside to all points on your designer's star. <em>(The addition of a surplus boss beyond the world-row-as-boss to showcase this concept with the message that design sometimes functions at its strongest when channeling both the positive and negative forms of the author's eye.)</em></li>
    <li>Deeper effects of your standing with a FoeLens on corresponding BossLens fight</li>
    <li>The $100 Budget exercise of the Idea killer row == switch palaces or something at the end of each world</li>
    <li>The Gunpoint Matrix as something you can track inside the game, giving yourself day-length tests to try and mark complete with conclusions</li>
    <li>Should we reward you or cut you off based on which petals you use most often? Or leave it 100% to players w/o rewards?<ul>
      <li>One way of implementing this, not in scope for the current month-long development cycle, would be petal power tiers, e.g.</li>
      <li>Kemoji: different levels of the wheel of emotions.</li>
      <li>Tyko: longer and longer chains, maybe even the choice between a simultaneous vs a one-by-one boost chain.</li>
      <li>Owens: different forms of defense, more like ground control options in a fighter.</li>
      <li>Dante: stronger or a tree of buffs and forms to turn into. (But go back and see Mark Brown's critique of skill trees.)</li>
      <li>Miya: how would you improve upon the prayer-style ability//?</li>
      <li>Jerome: maybe this expands whenever you reach a new highest-level tier across any of the petals? Means you don't get anything when you raise another petal to the level of an existing one.</li>
      <li>//Interesting thought: should I model how reality functions, or should I try to push them to what I think's better (e.g. each time you hit a max-tier for a petal)?</li>
    </ul></li>

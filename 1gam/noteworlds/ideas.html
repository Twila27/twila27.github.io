  <div><h1>Ideas</h1>
  </div>
  
  <div><h2>Implementation Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The more you add to your magic circle's world of replies to the Foelens, the more elements you have to choose in reply with during future encounters?</li>
  </ul></div>
  
  <div><h2>Unresolved Ideas</h2>
  <p>Needs a tiny bit more thought: WHAT IF BOSSES EMBED THEIR CHALLENGES UPON YOU?
	<ul>
    <li>When entering their world?</li>
	  <li>When encountering them at the level's end?</li>
	  <li>Maybe it also saves off as discussed for the Dragon to scar it with your very first prompt that comes up when it attacks you?</li>
  </ul></div>
  
  <div><h2>Wishlisted Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharing: ability to export canvases?</li>
    <li>Self-comparison: not hiding the canvases behind needing to talk to the seated lenses?</li>
    <li>What abyss takes the presence of a threat in the face of your goal? -- also DT, but fully formed, showing you the flipside to all points on your designer's star. <em>(The addition of a surplus boss beyond the world-row-as-boss to showcase this concept with the message that design sometimes functions at its strongest when channeling both the positive and negative forms of the author's eye.)</em></li>
    <li>Deeper effects of your standing with a FoeLens on corresponding BossLens fight</li>
    <li>The $100 Budget exercise of the Idea killer row == switch palaces or something at the end of each world</li>
    <li>The Gunpoint Matrix as something you can track inside the game, giving yourself day-length tests to try and mark complete with conclusions</li>
    <li>Should we reward you or cut you off based on which petals you use most often? Or leave it 100% to players w/o rewards?<ul>
      <li>One way of implementing this, not in scope for the current month-long development cycle, would be petal power tiers, e.g.</li>
      <li>Kemoji: different levels of the wheel of emotions.</li>
      <li>Tyko: longer and longer chains, maybe even the choice between a simultaneous vs a one-by-one boost chain.</li>
      <li>Owens: different forms of defense, more like ground control options in a fighter.</li>
      <li>Dante: stronger or a tree of buffs and forms to turn into. (But go back and see Mark Brown's critique of skill trees.)</li>
      <li>Miya: how would you improve upon the prayer-style ability//?</li>
      <li>Jerome: maybe this expands whenever you reach a new highest-level tier across any of the petals? Means you don't get anything when you raise another petal to the level of an existing one.</li>
      <li>//Interesting thought: should I model how reality functions, or should I try to push them to what I think's better (e.g. each time you hit a max-tier for a petal)?</li>
    </ul></li>

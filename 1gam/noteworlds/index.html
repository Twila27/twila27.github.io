<h1>Pillars<a id="Pillars"></a></h1>
<ol>
<li>To be able to use the design lenses that I've collected over the past several years (i.e. the game must also be a tool).</li>
<li>To be my foot in the door to beginning my personal quest's stage of reification</li>
<li>The personally reflective "note-world" aesthetic and presentation (plus the #1GAM theme of "Anthropomorphism" applied over it)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Prem<span style="color: #000000;">ise = Apply My Design Toolkit<a id="Premise" style="color: #000000;"></a> </span></h1>
<p>It disheartened me that, after spending so long collecting all these awesome ways to tackle making a game, I had no good way of registering the outcome of applying the myriad design lenses. Naturally then, I concluded to solve my problem by making it a game (in tandem with the OneGameAMonth.com #Anthropomorphism challenge).</p>

<h1>Gameplay<a id="Gameplay"></a></h1>
<p><em>The biggest concern:</em> balancing the need for efficiency and control as a tool with the desire for engaging fun in making that tool as a game.</p>
<h2>Gameplay Minute</h2>
<p>Platform around the level, locating and making your way over to a Foelens</p>
<p>[insert encounter design here after more paper prototyping it out]</p>
<p>Proceed onwards to the boss of the level, applying what's been used in the level to overcome them, granting access to next area (and a major component among the design lens?)</p>

<h1>Ideas<a id="Ideas"></a></h1>
<h2>Implementation Ideas</h2>
<p>&nbsp;* The more you add to your magic circle's world of replies to the Foelens, the more elements you have to choose in reply with during future encounters?</p>
<h2>Unresolved Ideas</h2>
<p>* Are the anthro concepts the intangible forms of the SoB cast?</p>
<p>* Story/World/Plot Seeds as collectibles? Perhaps some kind of fuel for your avatar's abilities, and/or pushing around your affinities (if we could combine them with their more bottom-up parallels)?</p>
<p>* Who it is that invites you towards and grants you the abilities you end up with -- little DT?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wishlisted Ideas</h2>
<p>&nbsp;* What abyss takes the presence of a threat in the face of your goal? -- also DT, but fully formed, showing you the flipside to all points on your designer's star. <em>(The addition of a surplus boss beyond the world-row-as-boss to showcase this concept with the message that design sometimes functions at its strongest when channeling both the positive and negative forms of the author's eye.)</em></p>

<p><strong>* Where did the original idea come from for turning to the inspiration-star as a gameplay system?</strong> Applying the "Platinum Death" (see .xmind) as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- The flow of situations == anthro concepts to encounter (after just thinking up a couple examples for Genrevolution from my toolkit), which led me to...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- The mechanics to overcome these encounters == I recognized the massive pattern of how I come up with mechanics <em>not</em> by blueboxing first but by drawing on the world which in turn implies the sought-after verbs. On day 1 of #1GAM I realized that "the world" I was drawing on was equivalent to the results of my SPSP, whatifs, etc. -- i.e. the inspiration-star itself!</p>
<h2><br />Backstory for Inspiration</h2>
<h3>A Flow of Unexpected Situations (making me realize it's honestly more world-x-plot... in the latter's cooler way)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Coming across the fallen Designer in the opening [note-world?]. Drawing on my experiences with moved-on inspiration/influence -- R -- and thoughts I've observed from Chris Crawford and his battle with his Dragon. I don't really see the fallen Designer as Crawford any more than I see them as the player or even myself some ways in the future. Nonetheless, the attempt to interact with this fallen figure triggers the appearance of the five Foelens that make up the designer's star in the form of triangles (being a broken-up star). I guess this implies you're initially just a pentagon? Initial encounters mixing together tutorial alongside of Earthbound-esque answer registering follow.</li>
<li>Shift in motivation: why would the player want to move from here onto deal with the Audience (AKA designer's spiral, player's eye) prologue note-world?</li>

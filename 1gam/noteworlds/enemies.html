  <p>Fun fact: foe-lens is an anagram of oneself, as <em>the key metric is self-comparison</em>. :) The inspiration for "anthropomorphized design <em>lenses</em>" comes from my fascination with trypophobia, pareidolia, and notetaking. 
    Currently there is no plan to inhibit the player by posing a threat to them, as this gets in the way of being a design tool--drawing more from games like <em>Yume Nikki</em>. This opens up a FoeLens to brush over the player freely for more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QINKbvzDBAo">Egg Boy</a> inspired behaviors.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Standing: any positive degree of interaction with them ensures they'll take up a theater seat. Past that, a more-answered FoeLens will be seated closer to the front & center.</li>
    <li>Appearance: heightmap displacement on a flat, tessellated plane mesh to emulate the awesome above style above of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naslinhasdocaderno/timeline">Joao Carvalho</a>.</li>
    <li>Existence: a FoeLens exists after being spun off by a [perhaps long-gone] designer.</li>
    <li>Activation: requires colliding into them using the designer star's boost capabilities--opening their world for you to "look through" said lens.</li>
    <li>Challenging: in order to convey a FoeLens' perspective, they speak to you through "challenge text" scattered around the floor and layout of their world and fired at you.
    <li>Answering: once inside a FoeLens' world, typed shots embed themselves <strong>as decals</strong> upon the canvas-like environment behind you. This process intensifies the degree of height displacement in the material of the FoeLens such that they reveal more of themselves the more you interact with them by making their silhouette more pronounced.
    <li>Reviewing: apart from the boss fight, looking through a FoeLens seated in the audience brings up this environment back up around you.

  <div><h2>The Per-World Bosses</h2></div>
  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://tsukikan.com/misc/cavestory/images/story/story_cavestory20.png"></src>
  <br/><br/><ol>
  <li><strong>DAWN:</strong> Open a trial with a boss at the start of a world--revealing the skeleton of your next Designer's Star shape to be pieced in with FoeLens drops from the current world.</li>
  <li><strong>SUNRISE:</strong> Though after every encounter the exit to the next room opens up, the lens you overcame triggers a camera shake and the rumbling sound of a dragon's roar in the distance--representing not that you made the boss easier, but bigger.</li>
  <li><strong>DUSK:</strong> Challenged by them at the end with the fruits of your work. To this end, the BossLens is the literal sum of all FoeLens encountered up to that point. (See above Cave Story boss for the gist.) In effect then, this represents the stage of revision in the brainstorming process--stepping back to take it all in and decide what you want to keep. Here this takes the form of hitting a part of the boss with the corresponding Designer Star ability used to write upon it, testing player recall (though collision with a part of the boss will open it up if you forget).</li>
  <li><strong>SUNSET:</strong> After overcoming them, you repeat the process undertaken with the Fallen in the prologue--being twilight upon exit--but instead of expiring, the satisfied designers bond with you to open the way to the next realm. The BossLens will also now take residence on the stage in the theater of the Backworld; although, any FoeLens encountered will take up seats in the audience even prior to finishing with a BossLens.</li>

  <div><h1>Enemies: The Foelens<span style="color: #ffffff;">: Actually Different Tables</span></h1>
  <p>Fun fact: foe-lens is an anagram of oneself, as <em>the key metric is self-comparison</em>. :) The inspiration for "anthropomorphized design <em>lenses</em>" comes from my fascination with trypophobia, pareidolia, and notetaking.
  <br/>Currently there is no plan to inhibit the player by posing a threat to them, as this gets in the way of being a design tool--drawing more from games like <em>Yume Nikki</em>. This opens up a FoeLens to brush over the player freely for more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QINKbvzDBAo">Egg Boy</a> inspired behaviors.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Standing: any positive degree of interaction with them ensures they'll take up a seat in the theater audience. Beyond this, a less-answered FoeLens will be seated further from the front & center.</li>
    <li>Appearance: heightmap displacement on a flat, tessellated plane mesh to emulate the awesome above style above of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naslinhasdocaderno/timeline">Joao Carvalho</a>.</li>
    <li>Existence: a FoeLens exists after being spun off by a [perhaps long-gone] designer.</li>
    <li>Activation: requires colliding into them using the designer star's boost capabilities--opening their world for you to "look through" said lens.</li>
    <li>Challenging: in order to convey a FoeLens' perspective, they speak to you through "challenge text" scattered around the floor and layout of their world and fired at you.
    <li>Answering: once inside a FoeLens' world, typed shots embed themselves <strong>as decals</strong> upon the canvas-like environment behind you. This process intensifies the degree of height displacement in the material of the FoeLens such that they reveal more of themselves the more you interact with them by making their silhouette more pronounced.
    <li>Reviewing: apart from the boss fight, looking through a FoeLens seated in the audience brings up this environment back up around you.

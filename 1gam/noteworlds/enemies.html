  <p>Fun fact: foe-lens is an anagram of oneself, as <em>the key metric is self-comparison</em>. :) The inspiration for "anthropomorphized design <em>lenses</em>" comes from my fascination with trypophobia, pareidolia, and notetaking.
  <br/>Currently there is no plan to inhibit the player by posing a threat to them, as this gets in the way of being a design tool--drawing more from games like <em>Yume Nikki</em>. This opens up a FoeLens to brush over the player freely for more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QINKbvzDBAo">Egg Boy</a> inspired behaviors.</p>

  <h2>The Per-Room FoeLens</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Standing: any positive degree of interaction with them ensures they'll take up a theater seat. Past that, a more-answered FoeLens will be seated closer to the front & center.</li>
    <li>Appearance: heightmap displacement on a flat, tessellated plane mesh to emulate the awesome above style above of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naslinhasdocaderno/timeline">Joao Carvalho</a>.</li>
    <li>Existence: a FoeLens exists after being spun off by a [perhaps long-gone] designer.</li>
    <li>Activation: requires colliding into them using the designer star's boost capabilities--opening their world for you to "look through" said lens.</li>
    <li>Challenging: in order to convey a FoeLens' perspective, they speak to you through "challenge text" scattered around the floor and layout of their world and fired at you.
    <li>Answering: once inside a FoeLens' world, typed shots embed themselves <strong>as decals</strong> upon the canvas-like environment behind you. This process intensifies the degree of height displacement in the material of the FoeLens such that they reveal more of themselves the more you interact with them by making their silhouette more pronounced.
    <li>Reviewing: apart from the boss fight, looking through a FoeLens seated in the audience brings up this environment back up around you.

  <h2>The Per-World Bosses</h2>
  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://tsukikan.com/misc/cavestory/images/story/story_cavestory20.png"></src>
  <br/><br/>
  <p>The boss is the literal sum of all you have done in the level, and here I stress literal.
  For the sake of building Anticipation, I think it best to tease the boss with the option to go there at any time, similar to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>.
  Therefore, though after every encounter the exit to the next room opens up, the lens you overcame triggers a camera shake and the sound of a dragon roaring in the distance--representing not that you made the boss easier, but bigger.
  <br/>
    <br/><strong><em>However</em>, you still don't face a new entity in the boss</strong> -- but a gestalt entity that represents your time to revise, prioritize and connect all the ideas you recorded in
    idually up to that point.
  ex. the Worldbuilding and Character bosses visually appear as all the preceding lenses plus the central grand lens (think <em>Cave Story</em>'s boss core fights, shown above) of Sekai-kan/Worldsense and Sonzai-kan, respectively.
  The central FoeLens flickers between the synonyms for these ideas.
  <br/>
  <br/><strong>What skills does the boss require the player to make use of?</strong> In effect, the player has to tame the creature built up through FoeLens encounters.
  Until you do this, though individual FoeLens will take up seats in the audience, their boss will not join you on the main stage of the theater.
  In effect then, this represents the stage of revision in the brainstorming process--stepping back to take it all in and decide what you want to keep.
  Here this takes the form of hitting a part of the boss with the corresponding Designer Star ability used to write upon it, testing player recall (though collision with a part of the boss will open it up if you forget).
  <br/>
  <br/>(The only exceptions to this pattern are the bosses of the prologue and epilogue.)

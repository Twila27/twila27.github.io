Not-Backstory: The Tyko BossLens Fight Beats
* The player is likeliest to try typed shots, based on what's worked for them so far--thus, they find that they can't talk at Tyko directly using typed shots.
* i.e. Shots will cover Tyko momentarily, but he will then brush them aside--however, when this happens Tyko's AI sends out another chain of his own.
* (DO NOT TEACH THE CHAIN ABILITY, THIS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS BASED ON SEEING HIM ATTACK YOU WITH IT -- INSTEAD, FOCUS ON TEACHING THE LESSON OF LISTENING/REPLYING.)
* Your listening and responding are shown through gameplay: your choice to chase after and enter these FoeLens created as the vertices in Tyko's chain attacks.
	- (Because FoeLens are just design lens AKA perspectives, there's nothing that says you can only have one FoeLens per designer -- this general norm just keeps things simple -- but they do all link to one world in total.)
* Tyko's FoeLens will travel past and away from the player as they chase after Tyko, who always floats backwards when the player draws near while the battle's early phase (but Tyko pauses while off-screen).
	- The world at this point is just endless expanse, as the below transition can take us to somewhere totally different for the ending.
* Being a chain made of multiple FoeLens, Tyko is also the player intro to having 2+ eyes leading to a shared FoeLens world--letting you piece together Tyko's challenge from the walled-off glimpses you catch.
* After you visit the final of all eyes (first "do not settle", second "but listen actively", and then "and reply genuinely"), the player can hit Tyko with a typed (not untyped) shot.
	- //This last lump also drops Tyko's petal for you--so the player doesn't "create" but rather "earns" it.
* When you exit this world for the final time by claiming it into your own experiences (as with the Fallen, holding G+H to add all worlds into yourself), Tyko and you will be at the world edge.
	- Tyko models how to hop up to the perimeter, waiting for you to follow.
	- If the player blasts over, Tyko waves to them with an approving smile.
	- If the player lands beside Tyko, he pats your shoulder and then nudges you (not all the way off) to jump.
* Tyko then leaves as aloof as always, revisiting only in the epilogue to use whatever # chains you used over the game against the Genre King, despite not being on-stage or in the back-alley with the others.
	- That said, it would be rude to not have acces to the Tyko fight's canvas (this being a tool), so maybe jerome pilots the boss of all prologue stars in the meantime (while the other 4 reside in the back alley).
/!\	- //This implies that you also then can't have typed prompts appear for the links in a chain, only the vertices -- because you have no way to sort and see all the typed shots you make using Tyko's ability!!!

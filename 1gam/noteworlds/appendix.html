  <h3>First Week's Entries</h3>
  The unceasing core tension for this project: a game is inherently about solving things inefficiently (*find quote!*).
  <br/>> Why enemies aren't able to attack and prevent you from shooting.
  <br/>> Whether to give you the ability to undo, vital in a tool, removes consequence in a game. //Does "inefficiently" == "with consequence"?
  <br/>>>> Along these lines I had the idea of whether to mimic my laptop whose battery has died and make it possible to lose things you've typed out, but //clearly this crosses some sense of a boundary line on what's acceptable.
  <br/>> On the flip side, however, games do add things to tools:
  <br/>>>> //The premise of this thing in a nutshell is that in my original mindmap tool I was overwhelmed, and my game presents the pieces of my design lens bag in a much more digestable manner (cf. chunking).
  <br/>>>> Secondly, it likewise allows me to arrange the sequence in which I present those chunks. //Mainly reinforcing Platinum Death here.
  <br/>>>> I have felt a more subtle tension when it came to "should I do it how reality works" vs "should I do it how I think it'd help me grow", e.g. when it came to making the designer star. Should this core system encourage going hardcore into one area, or instead reward you more frequently and strongly for being well-rounded?
  <br/>  
  <br/>* Prototyping with camera shake, engine Sounds, and faked VFX via Timelines -> Draw Debug commands and engine materials (or quick dupes of them)!

  <ul><li><strong>Where did the original idea come from for turning to the inspiration-star as a gameplay system?</strong> Applying the "Platinum Death" (see .xmind) as follows:</li>
  <li>The flow of situations == anthro concepts to encounter (after just thinking up a couple examples for Genrevolution from my toolkit), which led me to...</li>
  <li>The mechanics to overcome these encounters == I recognized the massive pattern of how I come up with mechanics <em>not</em> by blueboxing first but by drawing on the world which in turn implies the sought-after verbs. On day 1 of #1GAM I realized that "the world" I was drawing on was equivalent to the results of my SPSP, whatifs, etc. -- i.e. the inspiration-star itself!</li>

  <div><h3>A Flow of Unexpected Situations (making me realize it's honestly more world-x-plot... in the latter's cooler way)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Coming across the fallen Designer in the opening [note-world?]. Drawing on my experiences with moved-on inspiration/influence -- R -- and thoughts I've observed from Chris Crawford and his battle with his Dragon. I don't really see the fallen Designer as Crawford any more than I see them as the player or even myself some ways in the future. Nonetheless, the attempt to interact with this fallen figure triggers the appearance of the five Foelens that make up the designer's star in the form of triangles (being a broken-up star). I guess this implies you're initially just a pentagon? Initial encounters mixing together tutorial alongside of Earthbound-esque answer registering follow.</li>
    <li>Shift in motivation: why would the player want to move from here onto deal with the Audience (AKA designer's spiral, player's eye) prologue note-world?</li>

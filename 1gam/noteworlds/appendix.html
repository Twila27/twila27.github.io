  <ul><li><strong>Where did the original idea come from for turning to the inspiration-star as a gameplay system?</strong> Applying the "Platinum Death" (see .xmind) as follows:</li>
  <li>The flow of situations == anthro concepts to encounter (after just thinking up a couple examples for Genrevolution from my toolkit), which led me to...</li>
  <li>The mechanics to overcome these encounters == I recognized the massive pattern of how I come up with mechanics <em>not</em> by blueboxing first but by drawing on the world which in turn implies the sought-after verbs. On day 1 of #1GAM I realized that "the world" I was drawing on was equivalent to the results of my SPSP, whatifs, etc. -- i.e. the inspiration-star itself!</li>

    <li>Coming across the fallen Designer in the opening [note-world?]. Drawing on my experiences with moved-on inspiration/influence -- R -- and thoughts I've observed from Chris Crawford and his battle with his Dragon. I don't really see the fallen Designer as Crawford any more than I see them as the player or even myself some ways in the future. Nonetheless, the attempt to interact with this fallen figure triggers the appearance of the five Foelens that make up the designer's star in the form of triangles (being a broken-up star). I guess this implies you're initially just a pentagon? Initial encounters mixing together tutorial alongside of Earthbound-esque answer registering follow.</li>
    <li>Shift in motivation: why would the player want to move from here onto deal with the Audience (AKA designer's spiral, player's eye) prologue note-world?</li>

  <h1>Hermeneutics</h1>
  <h2>What is hermeneutics?</h2>
  <p>
    Hermeneutics is the theory of <b>interpretation</b>
    A hermeneutic is a <b>strategy</b> for interpreting the bible
    Everyone has a hermeneutic, just not necessarily a <b>good</b> one
  </p>
  <h2>Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    The bible is the <b>inspired</b>, <b>inerrant</b>, and <b>infallible</b> word of God, wholly sufficient for our instruction and clear in its message of salvation through Christ Jesus.
    A verse has <b>one</b> inspiration, but <b>many</b> applications!
  </p>
  <h2>Grammatical</h2>
  <p>
    Interpret the <b>plain meaning</b> of the text
    Interpret texts in their <b>genre</b>
  </p>
  <h2>Historical</h2>
  <p>
    Interpret texts in their historical context.
    Who was the author?
    Who or what was the audience?
    What was going on at the time?
  </p>
  <h2>Redemptive</h2>
  <p>
    Interpret the <b>unclear</b> in the light of the <b>clear</b>
    Interpret the <b>old</b> in light of the <b>new</b>
    Read <b>out</b> of the text, not <b>into</b> the text
    Verse, chapter, book, whole

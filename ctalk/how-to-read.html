  <h1>Hermeneutics - Seth's Document</h1>
  <h2>What is hermeneutics?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hermeneutics is the theory of <b>interpretation</b></li>
    <li>A hermeneutic is a <b>strategy</b> for interpreting the bible</li>
    <li>Everyone has a hermeneutic, just not necessarily a <b>good</b> one</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Foundation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The bible is the <b>inspired</b>, <b>inerrant</b>, and <b>infallible</b> word of God, wholly sufficient for our instruction and clear in its message of salvation through Christ Jesus.</li>
    <li>A verse has <b>one</b> inspiration, but <b>many</b> applications!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Grammatical</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interpret the <b>plain meaning</b> of the text</li>
    <li>Interpret texts in their <b>genre</b></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Historical</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interpret texts in their historical context.</li>
    <li>Who was the author?</li>
    <li>Who or what was the audience?</li>
    <li>What was going on at the time?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Redemptive</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interpret the <b>unclear</b> in the light of the <b>clear</b></li>
    <li>Interpret the <b>old</b> in light of the <b>new</b></li>
    <li>Read <b>out</b> of the text, not <b>into</b> the text</li>
    <li>Verse, chapter, book, whole</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  
  <h1>Hermeneutics - Ben's Notes</h1>
  <p><ul>
      <li>The #1 Rule: "scripture interprets scripture" -- it's the tool above all others for trying to understand what a verse (or chapter, book) means. (Similar to how "proving" or "disproving" the bible by some means other than itself would imply that thing has higher authority!)</li>
      <li><i><b>KEY:</b> for any unclear text, there is a clearer text with which that unclear bit is consistent. A way to help keep you from going off the rails based on a very specific wording of just a couple verses.</i></li>
      <li>On being written fully by God and fully by man (the "verbal plenary" view of the inspiration of scripture) -- 2 Tim 3 ("breathed by God"), 2 Pet 1:20+ ("spoke from God"), and Christ stating "scripture can't be broken" in John 10:34-35+.</li>
      <li>Why we read <---> How we read scripture (i.e. our hermeneutic) <---> What we read (i.e. our scripture)</li>
      <li>On the "clarity" of scripture: we came across several scriptures arguing that God's word is clear or needs no teacher (1 John 2:27, Jeremiah 31:34); however, we also noted 2 Pet 3:16 that Peter says not all scripture is clear (referring to Paul in particular). My understanding of it had to do with the clarity of the gospel message (as revealed more and more from Gen 3's proto-gospel throughout the books of the bible).</li>
      <li>In fact, this theme of seeing old scripture in light of newer revelation in scripture may be best summed up when Christ says he came "not to abolish, but to fulfill" the old covenant. Seth noted "progressive revelation" is the term thrown around here.</li>
      <li>Discussed the opening of Hebrews, and how it talks about the shift from God speaking through prophets to speaking through his Word we now have.</li>
      <li>Since we have the idea that scripture clarifies scripture, the question came up of whether the bible itself reinforces the above historical-grammatical hermeneutic's idea that the text has a fixed meaning for the time it was written.</li>
      <li>Seth said he came across Joshua 4:21+ (and I also found Joshua 4:6+ repeats this idea prior) in which those entering the promised land are told to answer future generations asking "What do these stones mean?" not with "Interpret it however you want/need" but a specific reason dating to the time/place they originally handled said stones.</li>
      <li><i><b>KEY:</b> disagreements tend to disappear when those in agreement apply the same hermeneutic. When taken together, the above 3 hermeneutics + the #1 rule act as a kind of checks and balances system to help us rightly represent God's word when it comes to doctrine. That's why it's a vital thing to share with others before diving deep on doctrine, with the exception of sharing the gospel message (which again, needs no teacher -- and we remarked that this is even held by the principles in our collective hermeneutic above).</i></li>

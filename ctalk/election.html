<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">//Notable Points of Discussion</span></strong><br />* The meaning of Nicodemus' reply (John 3:4) to Christ saying he needed to be born again.<br /> - During our discussion on the doctrine of man, we noted that Nicodemus could very well be acknowledging "How can WE affect our birth in a fallen state?"<br /> - Though other commentary doesn't rebut this interpretation, they generally take it Nicodemus here to just mean "I don't get it:" http://biblehub.com/commentaries/john/3-4.htm<br />* Jonathan bringing up that sin's "a process, not just an act."<br /> - cf. James 1:14-15, that "each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death."<br /> - Jacob noting how it's also interesting that the bible not only describes being saved as a kind of "birth" but so too applies this metaphor in describing "giving birth to sin."<br />* Isn't it a bit wild that the angels led by Lucifer rebelled against God, even having seen/been with Him? (No wonder they're punished so hard..)<br /> - And, as Jonathan pointed out, might explain why they're so envious of humans and out to lead them away from God.<br />* Regarding Matthew 24:24, and whether it implied it was possible for the elect to be led astray in the endtimes Christ described.<br /> - i.e. whether "if possible" referred to the elect or the false messiahs in that time.<br />* As far as how Seth came across all those corresponding verses listed above -- just a simple anyone-can-do-this keyword search for "elect" on BibleGateway.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">//Personal Thoughts</span></strong><br />* First, I think we have to be careful about rebuking people who react this way, because it can come from a place of general compassion. <br /> - i.e. How to draw the line between arrogantly "putting God on trial" and just trying to understand Him.<br /> - (Or, if we are honest and humble about it, at least what we can understand of God's ways).<br />* Second, I've always associated predestination with Deut. 29:29's line drawn between the things God has revealed and the secret things that belong to God. <br /> - So our discussion got me wondering whether there's a difference here between the things God has not revealed to us and the things we simply cannot comprehend being finite in contrast to his infinite nature. <br /> - When it comes to election, I can't help but imagine there's probably a little of column A and a little of column B here.<br />* Finally, on that "I don't think predestination/reprobation is fair" reaction depending not on your view of God, but of humankind: the question is not "why did God only choose some?" but "why did God choose ANY?"<br /> - A lot about how a person reacts to the doctrine of election (though I think esp. reprobation) seems to depend heavily on what order you approach the sections of God's Word as shown on Seth's Handout. The main outcome being whether or not God's at fault, or we're at fault. During fellowship the "what right do we have to put God on trial? Are we above God?" angle came up, and this echoes Paul in Romans 9:18-21 (a chapter nominated for a future week's discussion in general), which asks who a human being is to speak back to their creator. <br /> - I feel like the context of both Paul's style and audience here might help understand why he'd write so aggressively, because there's no way such a reply isn't going to polarize reactions to it.<br /> - If you establish the state of man first, I think it incites a less visceral anger towards God than if you jump right to "well, if God predestined some but not all as his chosen people, that means he has also predestined the opposite group to burn in hell." When you have first the premise that we destined ourselves to burn in hell, and that what God's done is to raise that from the default 0% saved. To this end we had a short discussion about original and imputed sin (e.g. Pelagian and Arminian views that imply you have something in you capable of saving yourself without Christ, compare Romans 3, Romans 5:12, John 15:16's "You did not choose me, but I chose you", Eph 2:8 and 1 Cor 15:21, which rose for us the question of federal headship -- whether you can claim redemption in Christ while foresaking having chosen sin for ourselves in Adam) as well as the inherited sin nature Paul writes about us still struggling to resist (but at least are able to resist, having been saved by Christ) and one day will be fully defeated when Christ returns (i.e. santification). Hence the coming Friday's discussion of Romans 9 where Paul provides a New Testament exposition for the story of Jacob ("loved" by God) and Esau ("hated" by God), in which Seth alleged Paul does an incredible job of anticipating and replying to objections on this topic.<br /> * tl;dr -- do you take election to be a consequence of God's nature? Or do you approach it from the reverse direction, gleaning God's nature from election (or again perhaps more specifically, reprobation)?<br />* The big question, then: with the preceding point in mind, how should we order these ideas -- is the status of man the first step, or is that making too big an assumption?<br /> - I personally think the gospel message spells it out, cf. the way that Paul chose to lay out Romans, putting the sinner status of man as the first step.<br />* For me, personally, the biggest concern this topic raises is the tension between election/predestination/reprobation and free will (see Week 2 below on Responsibility &amp; Ability for a more direct discussion of this).<br /> - I think the Pelagian and Arminian views and then the Reformed/Calvinist views tend to represent the two camps of thought regarding our agency when it comes to sin.<br /> - Why does God not extend the offer to all?<br /> - Is it a mystery unrevealed like Deut 29:29 talks about, yet also not something you can blame on God?<br /> - Or God does/did extend said offer, but we all chose/choose to reject him? <br /> - "Yes, but this was 'in Adam'" =&gt; Calvinist/Westminster camp<br /> - "Yes, but we choose in our lifetimes today" =&gt; Arminian/Pelagian camp. Key consequence: implies we have something in us that allows us to save ourselves.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">//Misc.</span></strong><br />* Historical applications stating their take on the doctrine of election: noted here mostly because I hadn't heard of the two London Baptist confessions before, only Westminster. :)<br /> - 1647 Westminster Confession of Faith (Reformed churches) <br /> - 1689 [Second London] Baptist Confession (Association of Reformed Baptist Churches, falling in line with the above outside the different views on adult/child baptism)</p>

<h1><span style="color: #008080;">Seth's Week 2 Handout (Free Will)<br /></span></h1>
<p>Man is depraved. There's nothing in us -that can even choose God- without him first choosing us.</p>
<ul>
<li>John 15:16, "You did not choose me, but I chose you," says Christ.</li>
<li>Romans 3:10-12, "As it is written: none is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside, together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one."</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Big Questions</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>If God predestined it all, how are we still held accountable for sin? </strong>Discussion: <em>i</em><em>f it weren't so, God would not be just.</em></li>
<li><strong>Does this mean there's no free will?</strong><br /> - Discussion's direction: there is free will; however, it is literally "freedom within our will," which as noted last week (see above) inherently unable to choose God because of the origin/imputed sin we committed with Adam.<br /> - Effectively this makes it the wrong question to ask, as our free will we inherently skew away from God, when left to our own devices.</li>
<li><strong>Justice vs Mercy:</strong> <br /> - i.e. a lot of the heat over this topic arises from effectively believing that mercy is then an unjust move by God.<br /> - But that neglects the reality that, without God stepping in, no one would be saved because the just punishment for sin is reprobation.<br /> - Interesting metaphor by Seth: killing a cockroach, an average person on the street, vs. the president. How much more grave then are the consequences for our having sinned against someone who infinitely above the president?</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility vs Ability:</strong><br /> * Last week, and Paul in Romans 8-9 deal most heavily with the "responsibility" part of this -- who is to blame for the whole election/reprobation thing?<br /> - However, having established that it is indeed us who are responsible / to blame for the predicament we're in before a just God, there is then also the question of free will from the angle of "is there any hope for me, if I can't choose God?"<br /> - i.e. "Ability" rather than "responsibility". Does God ask us to do impossible things? Yes, this as a consequence of his sovereignty, e.g. how he calls us to be blameless and holy the same way He himself is, cf. 1 Peter 1:15-16, when even Paul clearly speaks to the struggle between the old and new flesh.</li>
<li><strong>Prescience View:</strong> next week, didn't have time to get to it here.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">//Notable Points of Discussion</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//Romans 8-9 Discussion</strong></span><br /> - Noting how in the context of Jews and Gentiles being elect, not all Israelites or "children of Abraham" are the "children of the promise," as illustrated by Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau...<br /> - Something I hadn't known about: Ishmael as the result of Abraham trying to rush God's plan over his family's problems with infertility by involving Hagar, noting the parallel later experienced by Isaac likewise splitting his family line.<br /> - "Is this unfair?" as answered by Paul immediately afterwards when he says "who can resist God's will?" and "who are you, o man, to talk back to God?"<br /> [!] Noting that to think this effectively then views mercy (and it is mercy, as without any interference 0% are saved and 100% are condemned) as an injustice.<br /> - He also describes "a vessel prepared for destruction."<br /> - Noting that God's glory can be shown by putting his mercy OR his wrath (as when Christ was punished for all) on display.<br /> - For God to be a just God, can't just let sin slide.<br /> - Vital to understanding this: not even those who are elect got away free, because Christ had to take said punishment -- in a way representing the ultimate "vessel prepared for destruction."<br /> - i.e. "Either you are punished, or someone takes it for you." --&gt; Christ's Gospel<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//What's the point if God will save his elect people then, even should I decide not to spread the gospel to them?</strong></span><br /> - Answer: this is correct -- God will save his people -- but what is your place in it? Effectively whether you do this is saying more about your commitment and passion for Christ, in the end.<br /> - Growing up trying to study heavy into apologetics (because Dawkins and Hitchens were at their peak), I personally freaked out often thinking that if I argued poorly and "lost" discussions, I might have failed to save someone.<br /> - So personally, knowing God will save his people was a personal relief, letting go the arrogance to worry "I" was failing to save someone, when it's not me who does that.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">//Seth brought up the idea that "If you can choose it (salvation), you can lose it" as opposed to what's implied by God's sovereignty over both choosing and keeping his elect people.</span></strong><br /> - cf. the doctrine of "the perseverance of the saints" as I've heard it called.<br /> - Can't have the idea of God being able to keep us in Christ and not lose our salvation without the idea that God also sovereignly chose those people (i.e. the doctrine of election/predestination/reprobation).<br /> - On the topic of people who do fall away as having never been saved, there's the biblical example of what Paul said about Israel being literal children of Abraham, comparable to those brought up in church today, and yet not being "children of the promise."<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//Christ's answer to Nicodemus: "<em>the [Holy Spirit] blows where it wishes.</em>"<br /></strong></span></span>- Noting that this didn't seem to be aloof trying to avoid Nicodemus, but rather point Nicodemus to Christ himself, as seems somewhat developed later on when we see Nicodemus arguing in favor of hearing out Christ (John 7:50+) and later helping Joseph of Arimathea anoint and bury Jesus (John 19:39).</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//Final Point of the Meeting<br /></strong></span>- Ended on a discussion Jacob summarized well as understanding free will as coming from our time-bound perspective, and predestination as coming from the timeless perspective of God. Discussing the differences between the two prompted a brief nod to the "prescience" view we didn't have time to tackle, and being careful about what our view of God's nature and/in time implies.</p>

<h1><span style="color: #008080;">Seth's Week 3&nbsp;Handout-less Discussion (Final Thoughts)<br /></span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//Romans 8:28 (God works all things for the good of His&nbsp;people) &lt;&gt; Isaiah 10:5 (Assyria being both doomed and yet an implement of God's anger)<br /></strong></span></span>-&nbsp;Persons&nbsp;being held accountable for their actions even though they're instruments of God's wrath used to show his mercy<br />- KEY: the idea in Romans that&nbsp;God uses "vessels for destruction" potentially as a result of there being none to use which could be considered good (i.e. as all have fallen) -- with one mighty exception in Christ, but even this required vessels of destruction to carry out&nbsp;Christ's sacrifice.<br />- Additional examples: Paul in Romans 9:17-18 regarding Pharaoh, Luke in Acts 4:27-25 regarding Herod and Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//The Prescience View of Election: "God looks down the corridor of time to its end" to know whether or not to call someone.<br /></strong></span></span>- Trying to answer the question of "on what basis does God choose us?" although we have to be careful because we are&nbsp;told by Paul in Romans that "God's ways are unsearchable."<br />- The main problem: removes this choice from God, contrary to verses last week clearly stating we only chose Him, because he&nbsp;<em>first</em> chose us (like John 15:16).</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//The Morality of Human vs [The Fallen] Angels (or, "Why does Satan try tempting Christ despite knowing who He is?")<br /></strong></span></span>- Being careful not to step too far past what we can actually know about angels from the bible, or reading into these verses rather than out of them.<br />-&nbsp;Angle 1: the idea of "common grace" behind human morality, as Paul speaks of in Romans 2:15 with the law being written on every person's heart.<br />- Angle 2: being made in the image of God as an answer to why God would focus so much on us and saving us compared to the angels, drawing a parallel to how a parent focuses so much on their own children&nbsp;before others.<br />- Seth also touched on the fallacy of appealing to the animal kingdom for how&nbsp;secular morality should work, while skating over the details like how a wolf may eat her young upon perceiving them as a threat. In truth, the actions of the animal kingdom are not inherently evil, but they are also not inherently good. Discussed this point in light of how the animal kingdom worked in the world prior to the fall and its affect on creation.<br />- <em>Do angels have free will? Why do they seem to envy us so?&nbsp;</em>Grace is what we have, but they lost -- and cannot have, having chosen sin.<br />&nbsp; -- Adam pre-fall likewise having free choice in a manner similar to the angels bfore they fell -- with the free ability to choose whether to sin, and consequently choosing to do exactly that, resulting in a fallen fallout&nbsp;<em>even on all creation</em> (which "cries out", cf. Romans 8:19-27) as God states "even the ground is cursed" because of Adam's choice. But again, there's grace offered to Adam's line which the angels didn't receive.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//"How does God view us?" As individuals, or as a collective "bride of Christ?"</strong></span></span><br />- Personally noting how a lot of the worship you'll hear on radio stations tend to emphasize "I" and "me" over "us" and "we"...<br />- "The corporate body" (Psalms as the original template for worship) vs. our cultural bent towards individualism, when it should be&nbsp;<strong>both</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>//Time as incubation to grow Christ's body, or, "Why hasn't Christ come back for us already?"<br /></strong></span></span>- 2 Peter 3:9 ~ "the Lord is not slow concerning his promise [of returning], as some regard slowness, but is being patient toward you, because he does not wish for any to perish but for all to come to repentance."<br />- Going back to that idea that God will save all His people, no matter what, a personal reassurance to me to not&nbsp;fixate&nbsp;in paranoia upon whether or not I'm going to "fail" at evangelizing to someone or discussing apologetics (while as discussed last week not an excuse to ignore God's calling&nbsp;simply&nbsp;because He can find other means than me to reach those people).</p>

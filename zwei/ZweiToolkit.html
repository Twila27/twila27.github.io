<p>Platinum Games: "Action games are passive, as unlike horror/adventure games where you're in the active role, here you're always just reacting to the situation (with corresponding RGD parameters). This is the kind of situation Sun Tzu said to avoid--tactics only without real strategy and planning. Instead of unlocking lateral features, focus on feature depth--a la GMTK's 3 skill levels within Vanquish!"</p>

<p>Applying Santoalla's Philosophy of Music VS The Marvel Cinematic Universe's</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TYNLe8qjMc - The Last of Us, Composed by Gustavo Santoalla</p>
<p>	"I, in general, like not to have too much music in the movies."</p>
<p>	"I like the music to become relevant at certain points,"</p>
<p>	//"When you have a really dramatic scene, when something is really happening on the screen, why would you put music to it?"</p>
<p>	"You can turn something dramatic into something melodramatic very easily."</p>
<p>Man, that is a one of a kind composer right there. I'm kind of surprised to not have heard this aspect to this game until now; it's a fascinating approach to game/film audio composition on the heels of that Marvel Symphonic Universe video by Every Frame a Painting.</p>
<p>	- In that Marvel video, the uploader demonstrates how Marvel's music all hides or mutes itself, carrying </p>
<p>		1. no message or emotional reaction.</p>
<p>		2. no unpredictability -- every time, "what you see is what you get." Funny gets silly, sad gets a high note on strings. "The music tells you the same thing as the picture."</p>
<p>			-&gt; "It never challenges your expectations."</p>
<p>		3. good music covered up with other sounds like dialogue spoken over it where silence might let the music shine.</p>
<p>	==&gt; TOO SAFE A WAY TO SCORE A FILM. "Music is not meant to be noticed," like a bad reading of Santoalla's "Music is not meant to be in the way." //Instead, try risk!</p>

<p>1. DJ Cuatroman's 4-track approach: the goal here is to generally cover a decent range of the used octaves by filling them out in intervals with each layer.</p>
<p>* ambient (melody?), </p>
<p>* harmony, (look into [pow] chords for dummies?)</p>
<p>* drums, </p>
<p>* bass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Andrew: discussion we had at Yogi Bear Waterpark about how music in games tends to be tied to a larger context that was likely put in place first (as opposed to musicians who release standalone albums). Also that if all you do is just iterate until what feels good without a context, I feel that's no different from just spamming (but see #3) Generate on AUD.js, but in a DAW it's way less intuitive to do that because of its interface.</p>
<p>* for a given genre == K.K. Slider</p>
<p>* for a given char theme == Touhou, Megaman</p>
<p>* for a given area theme == Touhou, Megaman, Souls, esp. DKC</p>
<p>* for a given event == battle themes (Symphonia, Pokemon).</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Ghost Scale Channels trick!</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Having set up the above steps, now we begin to experiment around using the rule of BAG (base, adjective, genre, originally named rule of thirds): </p>
<p>  i. The base iteration.</p>
<p>  ii. The RNG-stimulus adjective.</p>

<span class="s2">My Worldbuilding Assumptions (underlying below approach)</span>
</p>
<p>  * Precedent-Antecedent Rule: every element comes from somewhere and has implications for something.</p>
<p>  * Emergent Dynamics Addendum: decisions in one area of worldbuilding will influence the rest!</p>
<p>  * Fantasy VS Sci-fi: Former thinks laterally to reality; latter thinks vertically! Both create anew + can satirize real life.</p>
<p>    - But as a result of lacking that frame of reference, explaining ideas in fantasy takes more time.</p>
<p>    ! KEY: ensure that unique world characteristics fundamentally serve the plot/experience goals.</p>
<p>  * What I Enjoy in a World: the satisfying mystery of forsenic visual storytelling and satisfying wanderlust of diverse areas.</p>
<p>  -  What do I mean by mystery here? The Vocaloid/Souls series "poker method" of not explaining everything.</p>
<p>    - What do I mean by diversity here? //Having 2+ distinct identities/views/voices to listen to and explore.</p>
<p>  * Extremes -- too much to intro/follow (beyond niche audience), or too little that isn't cliche (Tolkien, Arthurian, Norse).</p>

<span class="label">Wants</span>

<div class="notesContainer">
<p>//An Architectural Approach: establish player experience and then sekai-kan goals first!</p>
<p>0. Level Design's Goals: Require (Skillgates: The 1st Goomba) &amp; Suggest (Semiotic/Procedural Rhetoric: Boss Doors)</p>
<p>1. Form Follows Function: Pretty Messes vs. Player Experience</p>
<p>  - I first thought this should take the form of Versatile Verbs, which works for mechanics...</p>
<p>  - ...But moreover, a level "doodled" in editors or on paper "just because" lacks depth -- a pretty mess.</p>
<p>  - In knowing the intended UX, you can reinforce it all throughout the level: that's the depth a pretty mess lacks.</p>
<p>    a. Define the environment's story prior to the player's arrival.</p>
<p>    b. Define the environment's story during arrival: player purpose (goals/objective) for being there.</p>
<p>    c. Define the opposition to the objective(s). </p>
<p>    d. Define the set-piece scripted events (cf. Expressively Using LD Tools, except this is NOT the soup, but the entree).</p>
<p>2. MICRO: Instantiating Gameplay through Modular Parti //The Mood-[and-LEGO]-board Stage</p>
<p>  - e.g. Platform Variations, Saws' many uses in Meat Boy.</p>
<p>  ! Level-specific vs. Level-agnostic Mechanics (TF2 Pushcart)</p>
<p>  &gt; KEY: value of a parti == how many contexts can make use of it == its possibility space!</p>
<p>  { Bag of Micro-space Sketch Tools -- //Building a Mood-and-LEGO-board</p>
<p>        WoLD Tool: Photo Refs of Setting: location, surroundings, props, lighting, style, inspirational or otherwise.</p>
<p>        Tool #1: Non-Digital ARCHITECTURAL Drawing - Top-Down Plan, Cross-Section, Exterior Elevation, Isometric, Perspective</p>
<p>        Tool #2: Sketches and Journaling - Analysis of Real World Architecture + Screenshots in-game, for later Sketches!</p>
<p>        Tool #3: Paper Designs - Parti (Size-agnostic Form Thumbnails) + Graph Paper (Key Mistake: Not Sizing for Avatar/Abilities)</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p>3. MACRO: Pacing MICRO Instances via Nintendo Power Method, i.e. area maps with callout bubbles. //The Paper Map Stage</p>
<p>  - Shows map at macro-scale, to see it all at once -- where you place the visual landmark weenies, etc.</p>
<p>  - Each callout corresponds to an action-heavy RGD-challenging micro-gameplay instance -- //good LD paces them evenly.</p>
<p>  - Between callouts, //"circulation spaces" add Differences in Kind: movement, obstacles, exploration, puzzles, recharging.</p>
<p>  - To this, WoLD specifies adding where the choke points, spawn points, AI and player objectives, and cinematic points are.</p>
<p>  - //Scan and clean this Nintendo Power map in PSD.</p>
<p>  { Bag of Macro-space Principles</p>
<p>    * Encounter Design = Risk-Reward Gameplay: "uncertainty where the player knows the nature of the uncertainty."</p>
<p>      - i.e. How avatars internalize the external tools/powerups in the game to outgrow their basic state.</p>
<p>      - An environment overlaps gameplay here if it requires a certain [later, if Metroidvania] power of you to advance.</p>
<p>      - On a smaller scale, inject these into the "level beats" to form the Nintendo Power method's highs/lows.</p>
<p>      * Architecture tries to safeguard users with its wisdom; HOWEVER, level design spices that up with its exact opposite.</p>
<p>    * Pacing/Flow: Hildebrand's Alternating Sequence of Narrows, Refuges, &amp; Prospects in Size, Height, &amp; Lighting--//SEE XLSX!</p>
<p>    * Unknown Space: threats become synonymous with their environment, because you have to watch/listen for them!</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p>4. Physical &amp; Digital Prototypes: Pre-Art Whiteboxing</p>
<p>  (a) Clear out the dimensions in an editor with blocks. //Use the simplest brushes as needed to simulate collision.</p>
<p>    - init: parti-like interactive forms of levels (bits).</p>
<p>    - by end: like interior design, more art-centric.</p>
<p>  (b) Keep it to scale //so you can play as a player entity and explore it. </p>
<p>  (c) Check flow, travel times, sightlines, etc.</p>
<p>  2nd - playtest to see if intended exp is created.</p>
<p>  3rd - reiterate.</p>
<p>  4th - if only making tiny changes, editing little of major spaces, the level's ready for environmental art.</p>
<p>5. Digital Prototypes: Modularizing</p>
<p>  - From what details and refined geometry features arise in #5, we can create a "building schedule" (listing all prefabs, their sizes, and level [area] using them) and "style guide" (estab. color, graphics, metrics, etc) for our modular kit needs, passed onto env art.</p>
<p>  - //Noted Unity amenity: "vertex snaps" to other objects' sides and corners.</p>
<p>6. Visual Development: artists take over art direction: concept art &gt; modeler's lo-poly blockout &gt; tex art + modeler's hi-poly &gt; polish.</p>

<span class="s2">  - PRINCIPLES: A 5-Part Recipe for Worldbuilding</span>
</p>
<p>    A. A suggestion of familiarity: even Middle Earth has normal mountains.</p>
<p>    B. A hint of complex systems: artifacts in env, hints in narrative, characters showing up revealing aspects of world.</p>
<p>    C. A dash of cultural evidence: aliens, animals, whatever it is -- the Forerunner idea that a group inhabited an area.</p>
<p>      //HIGHEST RISK ACTIVITY HERE! Because you let the design and art teams loose on a vision to "backfill" it, i.e. clutter.</p>
<p>        - But #1, don't be lazy -- add things with a purpose. e.g. adding Buddhist prayer wheels to a game without Buddhism!</p>
<p>        - And #2, ask questions and question assumptions -- why does it look that way?</p>
<p>        &gt; BASICALLY: remove the randomness that easily creeps into cluttering areas.</p>
<p>    D. A big chunk of logical consistency: Kasavin! Breaking this will shatter the magic circle in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>    E. A pinch of topology: not unlike network topologies, i.e. connectedness of attributes, places, qualities, traits.</p>
<p>      //Why Tolkien went through finding out why humans, elves, dwarves all coexist in his world when he wrote Silmallirion.</p>
<p>      &gt; Can imply a bigger world than simply what's present!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<span class="s2">  - APPLICATION: 3 Steps to Apply Recipe Principles</span>
</p>
<p>    1. Determine Context: e.g. Real World vs Fictional World</p>
<p>      - RW: familiarity there, but comes with expectations. (Extreme: Days of Fallujah)</p>
<p>        - World Creation: REPLICATION and AUTHENTICITY.</p>
<p>        - World Consumption: REALISM and experience that is GENUINE.</p>
<p>        - Issues: augmentation (e.g. enhancing a sacred site), interpretation (e.g. Age of Empires and Korean patch), accuracy (e.g. "that's Clinton"), appropriateness (e.g. gunning Sikhs at their sacred site in Hitman).</p>
<p>      - FW: freedom without expectation constraint, but no familiarity.</p>
<p>        - World Creation: IMAGINATION and DISTINCTION.</p>
<p>        - World Consumption: DISCOVERY and experience of ESCAPISM.</p>
<p>        - Issues: generalization (e.g. Smite treating Kali like old Roman and Greek gods), emulation ("desert cultures" looking awfully Arabic-Bedouin, modeling an evil boss to look like a real-world deity that's benevolent), allegory (e.g. Dervish -&gt; Arbiter being a title in Sufi Islam like Pope being so specific in Christianity, and pretty-American Master Chief going to destroy the arbiter's faction--with 9/11 just having happened), artifacts (e.g. a moai being so specific to eastern island culture where their character design angered Polynesian cultures).</p>
<p>    2. Determine Complexity: How much is needed to actually make the world serve the narrative and experience goals?</p>
<p>      - Geographers learn how to do this from deconstructing our own world!</p>
<p>      - //May need all, some, OR none of these levels of abstraction:</p>
<p>        a. Climatology &amp; Atmosphere</p>
<p>        b. Geophysical: geomorphology (how landmasses form), hydrology, tectonics (Tolkien's world lacks here), gravity, etc.</p>
<p>        c. Biosphere</p>
<p>        d. Demographics: species, genders, ages, ethnicities, etc.</p>
<p>        e. Cultural Identities: language, history/lore, symbology, etc.</p>
<p>        f. Cultural Systems: faiths, politics, economies, transportation.</p>
<p>      - Biggest problem layers: history, faith, cultural identities and systems, geopolitics.</p>
<p>        - History: For RW this is persistent but volatile (so choose wisely), for FW beware echoing RW events.</p>
<p>        - Faith: with RW religions be careful about what you choose to portray and why, in FW avoid drawing on RW religions (esp. Roman Catholicism being used in bad guy alien priest designs).</p>
<p>        - Identities: representing a RW in off-the-shelf stereotypes (going back to lazy creation), in FW to make a group identity feel more real draw on languages, history/lore, symbology, etc.</p>
<p>        - Systems: tensions between nationalities and cultures on different issues in RW, emulation for FW like culturally-specific gestures (bullhorns mean "I'm sleeping with your wife" in Italy).</p>
<p>        - Geopolitics: for RW governments strongly watch this (China), for FW it's augmenting, enhancing, and borrowing geopolitical scenarios. (Several nations ban games for not showing locales as part of a nation, e.g. Tibet and China.) </p>
<p>    3. Create with Intent: Build the World's Layers</p>
<p>        - There's political correctness, but there's also the tension against needing to make profit in areas that will not accept your game without world changes.</p>

</h3>
<p class="labelsAndMarkers">
<span class="label">Optional/Wishlist/Misc.</span>
</p>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>  Ways of Seeing</p>
<p>  1. Identify what gameplay occurs in the space.</p>
<p>    - What are the game mechanics supported?</p>
<p>  2. Look UP as you walk around, notice visual elements, esp. art that contrasts the rest of the env. or somehow calls attention to itself.</p>
<p>    - Also look DOWN: is verticality used in reverse to make you feel in danger?</p>
<p>  3. Sense the space by its size, shape, and how it interacts with light, sound, and other spaces.</p>
<p>    - How do the lighting/sound conditions make you FEEL?</p>
<p>  4. Analyze level pacing. </p>
<p>    - Does it usher you through quickly?</p>
<p>    - Are there chances to explore?</p>
<p>    - Are these required OR bonuses for extra curiosity?</p>
<p>  5. Is there one gameplay style reflected in this level, OR are multiple supported?</p>
<p>    - e.g. A deathmatch map with places for snipers, but also rushers, turtles, etc.</p>
<p>    - Does the game play poorly for one style vs. another?</p>
<p>  6. HOW does the space express game narrative?</p>
<p>    - Is narrative a backdrop?</p>
<p>    - Does exploring the level tell you about the gameworld?</p>
<p>    - Are narrative events scripted to occur around you?</p>
<p>    - Or are there cutscenes?</p>
<p>  7. Examine any historical/gameplay PRECEDENTS.</p>
<p>    - What kinds of spatial experiences were in those games?</p>
<p>  8. Analyze composition, proportions, rhythms of env art elements.</p>
<p>  9. HOW does level geometry compare with avatar movement abilities?</p>
<p>    - Is everything well within their capabilities?</p>
<p>    - OR does the level space challenge these measurements?</p>
<p>    - Is there anything outside these capabilities?</p>
<p>    - If so, does game offer any way to expand these abilities?</p>
<p>  10. What env art elements REPEAT?</p>
<p>    - Are they interactive?</p>
<p>    - If so, do they correspond to a specific gameplay mechanic?</p>

<p>Oxenfree: always consider the what [is the player doing] and the why [are they doing it] -- most games escalate the what, but Oxenfree went with escalating the why while keeping the what consistently to conversation--and making dialogue be an ability, not a menu.

</p>
<p>1. Gameplay progression != difficulty progression.</p>
<p>2. Gameplay progression == structuring (PACING!) the distribution of game mechanics, mission duration +deaths, gameplay and audiovisual rewards, and difficulty/risk so as to not overwhelm or underwhelm players with too much or too little to continue playing.</p>
<p>2a. Progression of Game Mechanics: keeps player from being initially overwhelmed, e.g. if they were given the full Zelda inventory at once.</p>
<p>	- Style 1: Gated Access to mechanics until later in game.</p>
<p>	- Style 2: Directed Gameplay affording everything but missions/levels only require a gradually broadening amount of them.</p>
<p>2b. Progression of Mission Duration: harder enemies, longer distances, or harsher penalties (e.g. deaths/checkpoints) that gradually elongate the experience.</p>
<p>2c. Progression of Ancillary Rewards: environmental progression (scripted action events, landmarks and vistas with scaling intensity), also trophies/medals.</p>
<p>2d. Progression of Practical Rewards: see if Gamification book speaks to these points,</p>
<p>	- First, these are the most effective way to retain players.</p>
<p>	- Second, the best rate is to seem initially fast with a few nice awards very soon after starting the game, and then grow slower with time.</p>
<p>	- Third, players need to transparently understand the rewards system: when rewards come (automatically or not) and at what price if any.</p>
<p>	- Fourth, players should glimpse future rewards to anticipate and keep [re]playing.</p>
<p>2e. Progression of Difficulty/Risk: needs a curve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* The Real Problem: balancing the dynamics of progression as project scope rises. Ideally, the progression is designed and planned early enough to bring the producer and team leads on board into backing such an approach, but on first generation engines often certain elements remain unknown until deep into production (e.g. how different AI behaviors affect difficulty). So, it is best to both plan the progression in advance as much as possible (early production), and to set a planned checkpoint later on to update the progression structure with formerly unknown elements, and finally to set multiple review and feedback loops in the content to make sure the progression structure is supported, followed and satisfactory to focus testers. </p>
<p>	&gt; "Structure the gameplay progression early on and to build content that fits that structure from the start.  Realistically, the goal for us game designers should not be to build a Nintendo-worthy gameplay experience (it has taken them 20 years to get there), but to build the most enjoyable experience for the specific game we are working on and ultimately to make our users excited enough to play (and buy) our game. Then all will be right in the [game] world and [hopefully] the peasants will rejoice. M&rsquo;kay? "</p>

<p>  * DIALOGUE: two characters never talk about things that both of them already bloody know. //So solve it by making the inquiry not just more realistic but necessary. But the opposite problem is too much expository dialogue -- too many question marks in the screenplay. Dialogue isn't just for moving plot along though: moreover, like action, it's an opportunity to [indirectly] reveal character [as a byproduct of it]. It's NOT conversation, it's a dialogue -- sharing opinions on a topic. When dialogue neither advances plot or reveals character, you get The Room. Dialogue is only, then, as good as its character. Get into their motivations and headspace, and ask what they would say to show those to us. (SOUNDS A LOT LIKE GAMEPLAY!) Distinguish between what a character says and what they mean -- just saying how you feel outright is not how people talk. Dialogue is also conflict, a test of character's ideals, giving them a reason to talk in the first place, reveal their dialogue partner's trait and information to the audience. "Dialogue comes out of drama, and simultaneously creates drama, action-reaction. So treat it like any aspect of film: let it build and punctuate it with a climax that changes everything."</p>

<p></p>
<p>Dying Light</p>
<p>* Promo v. Concept Art: former meant to be eye candy and draw attention (made at end, the cherry on top), latter meant to define the vision (at start, the cake). This talk at Digital Dragons was about FUNCTIONAL concept art, the kind you don't see as often in image search results or ever on ArtStation.</p>
<p>* Dumpsters and lack of detail in th ebrief that can't include all the uses of a AAA environment art asset. =&gt; <span class="s3">The humility to recognize that you need to know how to ask after all those details.</span>

<p>
<span class="s1">* "</span><span class="s1">Conc</span><span class="s1">ept art can cause more problems than it solves."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">1. Asking what you need that concepted asset for in the game, i.e. nailing down the asset's purpose. Maybe color and size for level artist, but also where they can place it, which the 3D modeler could care less about, but does want the concept to convey the </span><span class="s1">materials and geometry needed by the asset. LDs will care about it for its functionality in their levels, parkour designers for its functionality relative to the player abilities. </span><span class="s2">Getting all this info precedes the creation of the concept art.</span><span class="s1"> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">2. Processes the old info from the concept's brief (i.e. feature request description) </span><span class="s1">vs. the feedback from step one -- esp. </span><span class="s3">looking for contradictions.</span><span class="s1"> e.g. LD needs it </span><span class="s1">170 cm tall, parkour designer needs 130. Can help both by showing the dumpster lid's slanted in the concept art -- but would never have known to do this without asking the asset's </span><span class="s1">users.</span><span class="s3"> Making the art first wastes time, because it'll just kick off questions leading to an inevitable [total] rework of that art--so it's best to get the questions in prior to making concept art. </span><span class="s2">Do the concepting before the art!</span><span class="s1"></span>

<span class="s1"></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">1. Answer more questions than you're creating.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">2. Remember what you're doing and why.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">3. Keep in mind who your concept art will affect!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s3">All of these become tougher with larger teams!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s3"></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s2">Should it all be in the brief?</span><span class="s1"></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">This blame game doesn't get the actual game any closer to completion -- which is your job foremost. </span><span class="s3">This is the real humility for a concept artist: knowing you can stand in the way of all the passions, aspirations, hopes and funding behind a game's development with just one dumpster.</span>

<p>
<span class="s2">The 3 Story Seeds + How to Grow Them -- //My what-if ("plotter") approach is just one of three options!</span>
</p>
<p>  1. Character creators: A character pops into their head and they write the book by following the character around. A famous example of this is J.K. Rowling, and her story about being on the train one day and basically seeing Harry Potter walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>    //Develop by finding the world/scenario they have the most impact on given their fears/wants. Who would they surround themselves with? What community would that take place within? Then consider the conflict that reflects their fears/wants.</p>
<p>  2. World builders: These are authors who find a time or place or some element of world building &ndash; like a system of magic &ndash; and go, &ldquo;Ooh! I want to play with that!&rdquo; Brandon Sanderson has talked several times about how he always figures out his magic systems first.</p>
<p>    [!] //KEY TO NOTE: doesn't start on a grand scale, it begins from a small piece just as much as character-building does!</p>
<p>    //Decide what part of the world you want to explore, and figure out all the rules that apply to that part of the world. Who lives there? What are their lives like? And what will throw that world into complete and utter turmoil? Once you&rsquo;re in turmoil, how do you fix it?</p>
<p>	3. Plotters: These are the people who go, &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; They start with the hook and build the book from there. Our own A Little Something Different is an example of this. What if we just had a traditional college love story, but what if it was told from the viewpoints of everyone around the main characters? Sandy Hall actually asked a teenage friend what book she wanted to read, and built her story from there.</p>
<p>    //The thing about a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; is that one &ldquo;what if&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t enough. The story comes from the conflict between two or more questions. And you&rsquo;re not limited to two. Every &ldquo;what if&rdquo; leads to another &ldquo;what if.&rdquo; Before long, as you answer all these questions, you will start to get a better idea of your world and/or the main characters. Then you can refer to the suggestions above to flesh things out!</p>

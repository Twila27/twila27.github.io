<span class="s2">1. Develop characters per Holly Lisle first, as characters are remembered far more greatly (for their characterization, not plot roles!) than narrative. ("We interact personally with characters, but we only watch plots impersonally.")</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s2">	- This also resonates with the Japanese pre-storytelling priorities of cast-before-plot.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s2">2. Align narrative with gameplay structure: UX, loops, levels/missions.</span>

<p>Platinum Games: "Action games are passive, as unlike horror/adventure games where you're in the active role, here you're always just reacting to the situation (with corresponding RGD parameters). This is the kind of situation Sun Tzu said to avoid--tactics only without real strategy and planning. Instead of unlocking lateral features, focus on feature depth--a la GMTK's 3 skill levels within Vanquish!"</p>

I had an idea of what I wanted this game to feel like, and at each step I identified something existing that I could improve and made that improvement. If it brought it closer to the feeling I was seeking, I kept it; otherwise, I tried again. If lack of a detailed vision of a finished product keeps you from trying to improve your game or art, I recommend identifying something that feels lacking, or which hints at but doesn't quite achieve a nice effect, and working at improving that aspect only. Move on when you feel you've made a true improvement. Repeat this a few times. See if you don't feel like the result is better than the original."</span>

<p>{ Oh My! That Sound Made the Game Feel Better!</p>
<p>  0. Sound goes 1st to the core verbs: guns for a shooter, car for a racer, riffle shuffle in a card game, etc.</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>  //How to achieve the above: </p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>  1. Make sound be the UI readout to not pause the action.</p>
<p>  2. Amount of business with all sounds going at once: no clashing frequences, unless that muddiness is warranted.</p>
<p>  3. Choose SFX that make the game's character feel unique instead of just Inception stings all the time. //It's uncreative, a wasted chance to stand out!</p>
<p>  4. Make sounds shorter! //Default towards a shorter duration unless the situation really calls for it (e.g. overencumbered in Souls example).</p>
<p>  5. Make the beginnings (i.e. attack) shorter, too! //"Like pushing a button," this makes a sound feel more responsive.</p>
<p>  6. [!] Make a small 5-20ms base "punch" "impact" sound file specific to your game, and then insert it into everything with bass/pitch/etc variation. //Adding it this way gives you that satisfaction of YOU having done the action, because the punch acts as an immediate confirmation. (e.g. Lever punch-then-pull sound, fall, punch-then-thud sound example.)</p>
<p>    &gt; THE IMPRESSION OF A PUNCHY (i.e. immediate) RESPONSE --&gt; TIE IT IN AS THE ZELDA SAGE OF SOUND FOR IMPRESSIONISM BLOG!</p>
<p>  7. Sound systems with ducking and filtering to make your player feel like their actions ACTUALLY SHAPE THE WORLD through its soundscape (e.g. gun filtering made it sound like your firing warped and distorted the world coming out of that gunfire SFX).</p>

<p>Applying Santoalla's Philosophy of Music VS The Marvel Cinematic Universe's</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TYNLe8qjMc - The Last of Us, Composed by Gustavo Santoalla</p>
<p>	"I, in general, like not to have too much music in the movies."</p>
<p>	"I like the music to become relevant at certain points,"</p>
<p>	//"When you have a really dramatic scene, when something is really happening on the screen, why would you put music to it?"</p>
<p>	"You can turn something dramatic into something melodramatic very easily."</p>
<p>Man, that is a one of a kind composer right there. I'm kind of surprised to not have heard this aspect to this game until now; it's a fascinating approach to game/film audio composition on the heels of that Marvel Symphonic Universe video by Every Frame a Painting.</p>
<p>	- In that Marvel video, the uploader demonstrates how Marvel's music all hides or mutes itself, carrying </p>
<p>		1. no message or emotional reaction.</p>
<p>		2. no unpredictability -- every time, "what you see is what you get." Funny gets silly, sad gets a high note on strings. "The music tells you the same thing as the picture."</p>
<p>			-&gt; "It never challenges your expectations."</p>
<p>		3. good music covered up with other sounds like dialogue spoken over it where silence might let the music shine.</p>
<p>	==&gt; TOO SAFE A WAY TO SCORE A FILM. "Music is not meant to be noticed," like a bad reading of Santoalla's "Music is not meant to be in the way." //Instead, try risk!</p>

<p>1. DJ Cuatroman's 4-track approach: the goal here is to generally cover a decent range of the used octaves by filling them out in intervals with each layer.</p>
<p>* ambient (melody?), </p>
<p>* harmony, (look into [pow] chords for dummies?)</p>
<p>* drums, </p>
<p>* bass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Andrew: discussion we had at Yogi Bear Waterpark about how music in games tends to be tied to a larger context that was likely put in place first (as opposed to musicians who release standalone albums). Also that if all you do is just iterate until what feels good without a context, I feel that's no different from just spamming (but see #3) Generate on AUD.js, but in a DAW it's way less intuitive to do that because of its interface.</p>
<p>* for a given genre == K.K. Slider</p>
<p>* for a given char theme == Touhou, Megaman</p>
<p>* for a given area theme == Touhou, Megaman, Souls, esp. DKC</p>
<p>* for a given event == battle themes (Symphonia, Pokemon).</p>

<p></p>
<p>
<span class="s1">My Worldbuilding Assumptions (underlying below approach)</span>
</p>
<p>  * Precedent-Antecedent Rule: every element comes from somewhere and has implications for something.</p>
<p>  * Emergent Dynamics Addendum: decisions in one area of worldbuilding will influence the rest!</p>
<p>  * Fantasy VS Sci-fi: Former thinks laterally to reality; latter thinks vertically! Both create anew + can satirize real life.</p>
<p>    - But as a result of lacking that frame of reference, explaining ideas in fantasy takes more time.</p>
<p>    ! KEY: ensure that unique world characteristics fundamentally serve the plot/experience goals.</p>
<p>  * What I Enjoy in a World: the satisfying mystery of forsenic visual storytelling and satisfying wanderlust of diverse areas.</p>
<p>  -  What do I mean by mystery here? The Vocaloid/Souls series "poker method" of not explaining everything.</p>
<p>    - What do I mean by diversity here? //Having 2+ distinct identities/views/voices to listen to and explore.</p>
<p>  * Extremes -- too much to intro/follow (beyond niche audience), or too little that isn't cliche (Tolkien, Arthurian, Norse).</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<span class="s1">* WORLDBUILDER VS SCRIPTER as Encounter/Puzzle Design (see below line? is this equivalent?) VS Systems/Interface Design</span>

<p>  - In knowing the intended UX, you can reinforce it all throughout the level: that's the depth a pretty mess lacks.</p>
<p>    a. Define the environment's story prior to the player's arrival.</p>
<p>    b. Define the environment's story during arrival: player purpose (goals/objective) for being there.</p>
<p>    c. Define the opposition to the objective(s). </p>

<p>3. MACRO: Pacing MICRO Instances via Nintendo Power Method, i.e. area maps with callout bubbles. //The Paper Map Stage</p>
<p>  - Shows map at macro-scale, to see it all at once -- where you place the visual landmark weenies, etc.</p>
<p>  - Each callout corresponds to an action-heavy RGD-challenging micro-gameplay instance -- //good LD paces them evenly.</p>
<p>  - Between callouts, //"circulation spaces" add Differences in Kind: movement, obstacles, exploration, puzzles, recharging.</p>
<p>  - To this, WoLD specifies adding where the choke points, spawn points, AI and player objectives, and cinematic points are.</p>
<p>  - //Scan and clean this Nintendo Power map in PSD.</p>
<p>  { Bag of Macro-space Principles</p>
<p>    * Encounter Design = Risk-Reward Gameplay: "uncertainty where the player knows the nature of the uncertainty."</p>
<p>      - i.e. How avatars internalize the external tools/powerups in the game to outgrow their basic state.</p>
<p>      - An environment overlaps gameplay here if it requires a certain [later, if Metroidvania] power of you to advance.</p>
<p>      - On a smaller scale, inject these into the "level beats" to form the Nintendo Power method's highs/lows.</p>
<p>      * Architecture tries to safeguard users with its wisdom; HOWEVER, level design spices that up with its exact opposite.</p>
<p>    * Pacing/Flow: Hildebrand's Alternating Sequence of Narrows, Refuges, &amp; Prospects in Size, Height, &amp; Lighting--//SEE XLSX!</p>
<p>    * Unknown Space: threats become synonymous with their environment, because you have to watch/listen for them!</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p>4. Physical &amp; Digital Prototypes: Pre-Art Whiteboxing</p>
<p>  (a) Clear out the dimensions in an editor with blocks. //Use the simplest brushes as needed to simulate collision.</p>
<p>    - init: parti-like interactive forms of levels (bits).</p>
<p>    - by end: like interior design, more art-centric.</p>
<p>  (b) Keep it to scale //so you can play as a player entity and explore it. </p>
<p>  (c) Check flow, travel times, sightlines, etc.</p>
<p>  2nd - playtest to see if intended exp is created.</p>
<p>  3rd - reiterate.</p>
<p>  4th - if only making tiny changes, editing little of major spaces, the level's ready for environmental art.</p>
<p>5. Digital Prototypes: Modularizing</p>
<p>  - From what details and refined geometry features arise in #5, we can create a "building schedule" (listing all prefabs, their sizes, and level [area] using them) and "style guide" (estab. color, graphics, metrics, etc) for our modular kit needs, passed onto env art.</p>
<p>  - //Noted Unity amenity: "vertex snaps" to other objects' sides and corners.</p>
<p>6. Visual Development: artists take over art direction: concept art &gt; modeler's lo-poly blockout &gt; tex art + modeler's hi-poly &gt; polish.</p>
<p>7. Level Design Workflows: Whitebox &gt; Adding Assets &amp; Lighting &gt; Polish</p>

<span class="s1">  - PRINCIPLES: A 5-Part Recipe for Worldbuilding</span>
</p>
<p>    A. A suggestion of familiarity: even Middle Earth has normal mountains.</p>
<p>    B. A hint of complex systems: artifacts in env, hints in narrative, characters showing up revealing aspects of world.</p>
<p>    C. A dash of cultural evidence: aliens, animals, whatever it is -- the Forerunner idea that a group inhabited an area.</p>
<p>      //HIGHEST RISK ACTIVITY HERE! Because you let the design and art teams loose on a vision to "backfill" it, i.e. clutter.</p>
<p>        - But #1, don't be lazy -- add things with a purpose. e.g. adding Buddhist prayer wheels to a game without Buddhism!</p>
<p>        - And #2, ask questions and question assumptions -- why does it look that way?</p>
<p>        &gt; BASICALLY: remove the randomness that easily creeps into cluttering areas.</p>
<p>    D. A big chunk of logical consistency: Kasavin! Breaking this will shatter the magic circle in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>    E. A pinch of topology: not unlike network topologies, i.e. connectedness of attributes, places, qualities, traits.</p>
<p>      //Why Tolkien went through finding out why humans, elves, dwarves all coexist in his world when he wrote Silmallirion.</p>
<p>      &gt; Can imply a bigger world than simply what's present!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<span class="s1">  - APPLICATION: 3 Steps to Apply Recipe Principles</span>
</p>
<p>    1. Determine Context: e.g. Real World vs Fictional World</p>
<p>      - RW: familiarity there, but comes with expectations. (Extreme: Days of Fallujah)</p>
<p>        - World Creation: REPLICATION and AUTHENTICITY.</p>
<p>        - World Consumption: REALISM and experience that is GENUINE.</p>
<p>        - Issues: augmentation (e.g. enhancing a sacred site), interpretation (e.g. Age of Empires and Korean patch), accuracy (e.g. "that's Clinton"), appropriateness (e.g. gunning Sikhs at their sacred site in Hitman).</p>
<p>      - FW: freedom without expectation constraint, but no familiarity.</p>
<p>        - World Creation: IMAGINATION and DISTINCTION.</p>
<p>        - World Consumption: DISCOVERY and experience of ESCAPISM.</p>
<p>        - Issues: generalization (e.g. Smite treating Kali like old Roman and Greek gods), emulation ("desert cultures" looking awfully Arabic-Bedouin, modeling an evil boss to look like a real-world deity that's benevolent), allegory (e.g. Dervish -&gt; Arbiter being a title in Sufi Islam like Pope being so specific in Christianity, and pretty-American Master Chief going to destroy the arbiter's faction--with 9/11 just having happened), artifacts (e.g. a moai being so specific to eastern island culture where their character design angered Polynesian cultures).</p>
<p>    2. Determine Complexity: How much is needed to actually make the world serve the narrative and experience goals?</p>
<p>      - Geographers learn how to do this from deconstructing our own world!</p>
<p>      - //May need all, some, OR none of these levels of abstraction:</p>
<p>        a. Climatology &amp; Atmosphere</p>
<p>        b. Geophysical: geomorphology (how landmasses form), hydrology, tectonics (Tolkien's world lacks here), gravity, etc.</p>
<p>        c. Biosphere</p>
<p>        d. Demographics: species, genders, ages, ethnicities, etc.</p>
<p>        e. Cultural Identities: language, history/lore, symbology, etc.</p>
<p>        f. Cultural Systems: faiths, politics, economies, transportation.</p>
<p>      - Biggest problem layers: history, faith, cultural identities and systems, geopolitics.</p>
<p>        - History: For RW this is persistent but volatile (so choose wisely), for FW beware echoing RW events.</p>
<p>        - Faith: with RW religions be careful about what you choose to portray and why, in FW avoid drawing on RW religions (esp. Roman Catholicism being used in bad guy alien priest designs).</p>
<p>        - Identities: representing a RW in off-the-shelf stereotypes (going back to lazy creation), in FW to make a group identity feel more real draw on languages, history/lore, symbology, etc.</p>
<p>        - Systems: tensions between nationalities and cultures on different issues in RW, emulation for FW like culturally-specific gestures (bullhorns mean "I'm sleeping with your wife" in Italy).</p>
<p>        - Geopolitics: for RW governments strongly watch this (China), for FW it's augmenting, enhancing, and borrowing geopolitical scenarios. (Several nations ban games for not showing locales as part of a nation, e.g. Tibet and China.) </p>
<p>    3. Create with Intent: Build the World's Layers</p>
<p>        - There's political correctness, but there's also the tension against needing to make profit in areas that will not accept your game without world changes.</p>

</h3>
<p class="labelsAndMarkers">
<span class="label">Optional/Wishlist/Misc.</span>
</p>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>  Ways of Seeing</p>
<p>  1. Identify what gameplay occurs in the space.</p>
<p>    - What are the game mechanics supported?</p>
<p>  2. Look UP as you walk around, notice visual elements, esp. art that contrasts the rest of the env. or somehow calls attention to itself.</p>
<p>    - Also look DOWN: is verticality used in reverse to make you feel in danger?</p>
<p>  3. Sense the space by its size, shape, and how it interacts with light, sound, and other spaces.</p>
<p>    - How do the lighting/sound conditions make you FEEL?</p>
<p>  4. Analyze level pacing. </p>
<p>    - Does it usher you through quickly?</p>
<p>    - Are there chances to explore?</p>
<p>    - Are these required OR bonuses for extra curiosity?</p>
<p>  5. Is there one gameplay style reflected in this level, OR are multiple supported?</p>
<p>    - e.g. A deathmatch map with places for snipers, but also rushers, turtles, etc.</p>
<p>    - Does the game play poorly for one style vs. another?</p>
<p>  6. HOW does the space express game narrative?</p>
<p>    - Is narrative a backdrop?</p>
<p>    - Does exploring the level tell you about the gameworld?</p>
<p>    - Are narrative events scripted to occur around you?</p>
<p>    - Or are there cutscenes?</p>
<p>  7. Examine any historical/gameplay PRECEDENTS.</p>
<p>    - What kinds of spatial experiences were in those games?</p>
<p>  8. Analyze composition, proportions, rhythms of env art elements.</p>
<p>  9. HOW does level geometry compare with avatar movement abilities?</p>
<p>    - Is everything well within their capabilities?</p>
<p>    - OR does the level space challenge these measurements?</p>
<p>    - Is there anything outside these capabilities?</p>
<p>    - If so, does game offer any way to expand these abilities?</p>
<p>  10. What env art elements REPEAT?</p>
<p>    - Are they interactive?</p>
<p>    - If so, do they correspond to a specific gameplay mechanic?</p>

</p>
<p>1. Gameplay progression != difficulty progression.</p>
<p>2. Gameplay progression == structuring (PACING!) the distribution of game mechanics, mission duration +deaths, gameplay and audiovisual rewards, and difficulty/risk so as to not overwhelm or underwhelm players with too much or too little to continue playing.</p>
<p>2a. Progression of Game Mechanics: keeps player from being initially overwhelmed, e.g. if they were given the full Zelda inventory at once.</p>
<p>	- Style 1: Gated Access to mechanics until later in game.</p>
<p>	- Style 2: Directed Gameplay affording everything but missions/levels only require a gradually broadening amount of them.</p>
<p>2b. Progression of Mission Duration: harder enemies, longer distances, or harsher penalties (e.g. deaths/checkpoints) that gradually elongate the experience.</p>
<p>2c. Progression of Ancillary Rewards: environmental progression (scripted action events, landmarks and vistas with scaling intensity), also trophies/medals.</p>
<p>2d. Progression of Practical Rewards: see if Gamification book speaks to these points,</p>
<p>	- First, these are the most effective way to retain players.</p>
<p>	- Second, the best rate is to seem initially fast with a few nice awards very soon after starting the game, and then grow slower with time.</p>
<p>	- Third, players need to transparently understand the rewards system: when rewards come (automatically or not) and at what price if any.</p>
<p>	- Fourth, players should glimpse future rewards to anticipate and keep [re]playing.</p>
<p>2e. Progression of Difficulty/Risk: needs a curve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* The Real Problem: balancing the dynamics of progression as project scope rises. Ideally, the progression is designed and planned early enough to bring the producer and team leads on board into backing such an approach, but on first generation engines often certain elements remain unknown until deep into production (e.g. how different AI behaviors affect difficulty). So, it is best to both plan the progression in advance as much as possible (early production), and to set a planned checkpoint later on to update the progression structure with formerly unknown elements, and finally to set multiple review and feedback loops in the content to make sure the progression structure is supported, followed and satisfactory to focus testers. </p>
<p>	&gt; "Structure the gameplay progression early on and to build content that fits that structure from the start.  Realistically, the goal for us game designers should not be to build a Nintendo-worthy gameplay experience (it has taken them 20 years to get there), but to build the most enjoyable experience for the specific game we are working on and ultimately to make our users excited enough to play (and buy) our game. Then all will be right in the [game] world and [hopefully] the peasants will rejoice. M&rsquo;kay? "</p>

<p>//Low-Poly Talk</p>
<p>{ * Atomic Size's Rigidity of Detail Budget: Communicates that there's a finite amount of detail we're working with in this scene -- a sense of order and cohesion.</p>
<p>	&gt; Then toying with this, using atomic size as only a lower-bound such that each model can have its own local atomic size.</p>
<p>	&gt; Dispersal Technique = Global Atom Size (using resolution uniformly): a very rough fit of the scene, we spread polys equally over the scene (hence "dispersal") keeping atomic size comparable.</p>
<p>		--&gt; Dense, rich, lush for a forest scene or a city you don't need detail for, just lots of things to look at.</p>
<p>	&gt; Accumulation Technique = Local Atom Size (using resolution deliberately): a more accurate fit, we have more detail on the individual elements of the scene (hence "accumulation") letting atomic size vary model to model.</p>
<p>		--&gt; Innate composition, much more readable and much less muddy (though muddiness gives you something to look at, at all times), but the clarity here can be used to draw the eye in level design.</p>
<p></p>
<p>	&gt; COMBINE THEM: use Dispersal techniques over the environment (esp. to catch additional light/shadow with all that spread-out poly detail in modern game engines, or to make a scene feel less empty in general) and use Accumulation over "Hero" assets, i.e. larger more focal props, and the resulting hotspotting of polygonal density causes a "breadcrumbing" that can even remove the need for text in a game.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>{ * Silhouette Consciousness: stripping away the detail and exaggerating what's important (the Blazing Legion hand example). USE STRONG SILHOUETTES TO MAKE LOW-POLY MODELS STAND OUT.</p>
<p>	- Overall Shape Legibility</p>
<p>	- How Light/Shadow Interacts (i.e. where you need poly detail to cause shadow)</p>
<p>	- Over/Underselling Curvature</p>
<p>* Using low-poly to focus only on what's important about the model (whether it needs to animate/be rigged = a fist, whether it needs fingers or just an index for trigger actions), and then use subdivision modeling as for the 3.4k Blazing Legion hand (revisiting the low-poly and re-subdividing after changing it to allow for more drastic changes to the silhouette like shoulder width and hip height).</p>
<p>	- DON'T JUST DECIMATE.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>{ * Trick Bag</p>
<p>	- Low Resolution Rendering: excusing the popping-in of geometry out of nowhere in the Star Fox example.</p>
<p>	- Color Palettes as Textures ("per face color"?), a great way to batch materials (2-3 in an entire game, saves tons of render time paired w/low-poly count, esp. if unlit look! -- "sticker vibe" like the guy on the left)</p>
<p>	- Fun with Flipped Normals: cheap glass (because you see through the face), anything semitransparent.</p>
<p>	- Scrolling UVs: the Star Wars X-wing tunnel glow.</p>
<p>	- Combining flipped normals and scrolling UVs to make the planet atmosphere example.</p>

<p>  * DIALOGUE: two characters never talk about things that both of them already bloody know. //So solve it by making the inquiry not just more realistic but necessary. But the opposite problem is too much expository dialogue -- too many question marks in the screenplay. Dialogue isn't just for moving plot along though: moreover, like action, it's an opportunity to [indirectly] reveal character [as a byproduct of it]. It's NOT conversation, it's a dialogue -- sharing opinions on a topic. When dialogue neither advances plot or reveals character, you get The Room. Dialogue is only, then, as good as its character. Get into their motivations and headspace, and ask what they would say to show those to us. (SOUNDS A LOT LIKE GAMEPLAY!) Distinguish between what a character says and what they mean -- just saying how you feel outright is not how people talk. Dialogue is also conflict, a test of character's ideals, giving them a reason to talk in the first place, reveal their dialogue partner's trait and information to the audience. "Dialogue comes out of drama, and simultaneously creates drama, action-reaction. So treat it like any aspect of film: let it build and punctuate it with a climax that changes everything."</p>

LDs will care about it for its functionality in their levels, parkour designers for its functionality relative to the player abilities. </span><span class="s1">Getting all this info precedes the creation of the concept art.</span><span class="s2"> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s2">2.

</p>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>Minimalism in the late Chuck Jones: "Use the smallest possible facial gestures to get laughs." --&gt; Apply on pixel art?</p>
<p></p>
<p>{ Minimalist Game Design: //NOW ADD ME TO ZWEI TOOLKIT? WHERE? UP WITH SICART GRADIENTS?</p>
<p>  - S1-2 MINIMALIST GAME DESIGN'S GOAL: "to allow for high-level activities [core loop(s)] that consist of a small set of rearrangable micro-mechanics."</p>
<p>  - S3.1 IN SYSTEMS: "Tight coupling" as one technique to achieve this, at the cost of needing more design iterations to balance the coupled systems (e.g. your size is your health/life in Osmos, your x-position is your time-position in Braid). This cost obviously works better in minimalist games, because they are defined by having fewer rules and mechanics, resulting in less combinatorial complexity.</p>
<p>  - S3.2 IN CONTROLS: "Analyze the control scheme of a game as discrete/continuous I/O, and use the level of discretization as a balancing/tuning parameter. In our experience, discrete schemes have a tendency to be more accessible and map to a wider variety of hardware devices, without compromising on depth of player expression."</p>
<p>  - S3.3-3.4 IN AUDIOVISUALS: non-photorealistic or otherwise stylized, at most. Like infographics and reductionist art, success here depends on how you map the system state to a visual representation such that players can interpret your game. First, you have to decide how much of the system's black box to show (similar to encapsulation in OO programming), and subsequently the choice of visuals you use to show those details (with reference to the Heider-Simmel test for animations). In particular, minimalist games tend to leverage the increased capacity that abstract art has to provide high amounts of contrast without causing the uncanny valley effects that photorealistic visuals would suffer.</p>
<p>} </p>
<p>{ Minimalist Game Design: Narrative, System, &amp; Aesthetic Design Tips //COMBINE WITH ABOVE!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some tips for approaching narrative design from a minimalist standpoint:</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Avoid extensive exposition. Instead of starting the game with a voice-over, cut scene, or text crawl, put the player in an interactive role. Set the scene with mood and atmosphere rather than words. Introduce characters with actions rather than biographies.</p>
<p>* Value exploration over explanation. Reward players for exploring your world rather than burdening them with excessive pages of lore and back story.</p>
<p>* Avoid optional collectibles that explain crucial details of your world's history. Find ways to implement this information into gameplay rather than audio files.</p>
<p>* Silence can be just as valuable as conversation. Use body language and facial expressions to express feelings when possible.</p>
<p>* Make the player ask questions and don't be afraid to never answer them. If every detail of a game is laid out for the player to discover, then the game has a finite depth. Mysteries and the unknown represent areas that have never been explored and will exist in the minds of players long after they put the controller down.</p>
<p>* Complex character progression can be the focus within an incredibly simple plot. Remember that minimalism can be used as a contrast between two things to create a deceptively deep experience.</p>
<p>    
</p>
<p>System Design</p>
<p></p>
<p>* //Always side with familiarity over uniqueness. This sounds incredibly counter-productive for anyone trying to create something new, but it's true. If you're making something that is in any way familiar to something that already exists, then your players are going to have pre-existing expectations. Don't reinvent the wheel when your players are already familiar with driving.</p>
<p>* Use context-sensitive inputs rather than expansive control schemes. If your player can open chests and doors, the same button should perform both actions. It is up to you, as a designer, to make sure that doors and chests never overlap.</p>
<p>* To expand on the context-sensitive inputs: a single button can be pressed in more than one way. Single tap, double tap, extended hold, rhythmic tap; these are all different ways to press the same button. It may be tempting to take advantage of an entire controller, but try to find ways to limit the number of buttons your player has to press when it makes sense.</p>
<p>* Use timing and rhythm-based solutions to puzzles and conflicts. Players can pick up on these gameplay patterns without having to rely on intrusive instructions or explanations.</p>
<p>* Force players to learn through experimentation directly after discovering a new ability. Without relying on text boxes and tutorials, you can immediately require the use of the ability to solve a problem before the player can continue. Then, as the designer, it's your job to make sure that this ability remains relevant throughout the rest of the game so that the player doesn't forget about it.</p>
<p>* //Give your players a reason to NOT press a button. If shooting endlessly down a hallway is a solution, then not shooting endlessly down a different hallway can be another solution. Instead of adding new gameplay mechanics, think of ways to temporarily remove existing mechanics to add new gameplay experiences.</p>
<p>* Avoid redundancies. Giving players a variety of choices is usually a good thing, but make sure that a highly preferred choice doesn't create obsolete solutions. For example, a jet pack power-up will make your grappling hook and double jump power-ups useless. When one solution is obviously superior, the other solutions immediately become pointless and excessive. If you have multiple solutions, make sure that they each provide a unique and valuable reward.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aesthetic Design</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Use a limited and deliberate color palette. Colors can represent emotions, moods, locations, temperatures, and personalities. Being consistent and tasteful in your choice of color is far more important than using a certain variety of colors.</p>
<p>* Contrast is your friend. When using limited visual assets, the contrast between those assets becomes just as important as the assets themselves. Blank space between items should be used to your advantage when dealing with a limited number of on-screen elements.</p>
<p>* Use simple and recognizable shapes. If you're not familiar with the intricacies of art and design, you should at least learn about the importance of silhouettes. Take the most detailed element in your scene and reduce it to a single color. Is it still readable? By working with limited colors, you can build recognizable scenes that will remain readable as you increase the fidelity of those elements over time.</p>
<p>* Lighting is more important than poly count. A low-poly scene with superb lighting is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>* Use colors or light to direct players towards a destination rather than HUD elements, maps, and markers.</p>
<p>* Integrate potential HUD elements into the game's environment where possible. Think of a digital readout on the side of a gun to represent ammo, or an inventory system that exists in physical space within a player's backpack rather than in a menu screen.</p>
<p>* High quality animation on a less detailed character is far more valuable than a badly animated photo-realistic character.</p>
<p>* Use real-time lighting to represent time, rather than an on-screen clock.</p>
<p>* Use damage models or other unique environmental solutions to represent health instead of on-screen meters. Think of an enemy moving more slowly or walking with a limp to represent low health.</p>
<p>* Use animated GIFs to advertise your game if your minimalist aesthetic design results in unreadable screenshots.</p>

<p>
<span class="s1">The 3 Story Seeds + How to Grow Them -- //My what-if ("plotter") approach is just one of three options!</span>
</p>
<p>  1. Character creators: A character pops into their head and they write the book by following the character around. A famous example of this is J.K. Rowling, and her story about being on the train one day and basically seeing Harry Potter walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>    //Develop by finding the world/scenario they have the most impact on given their fears/wants. Who would they surround themselves with? What community would that take place within? Then consider the conflict that reflects their fears/wants.</p>
<p>  2. World builders: These are authors who find a time or place or some element of world building &ndash; like a system of magic &ndash; and go, &ldquo;Ooh! I want to play with that!&rdquo; Brandon Sanderson has talked several times about how he always figures out his magic systems first.</p>
<p>    [!] //KEY TO NOTE: doesn't start on a grand scale, it begins from a small piece just as much as character-building does!</p>
<p>    //Decide what part of the world you want to explore, and figure out all the rules that apply to that part of the world. Who lives there? What are their lives like? And what will throw that world into complete and utter turmoil? Once you&rsquo;re in turmoil, how do you fix it?</p>
<p>	3. Plotters: These are the people who go, &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; They start with the hook and build the book from there. Our own A Little Something Different is an example of this. What if we just had a traditional college love story, but what if it was told from the viewpoints of everyone around the main characters? Sandy Hall actually asked a teenage friend what book she wanted to read, and built her story from there.</p>
<p>    //The thing about a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; is that one &ldquo;what if&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t enough. The story comes from the conflict between two or more questions. And you&rsquo;re not limited to two. Every &ldquo;what if&rdquo; leads to another &ldquo;what if.&rdquo; Before long, as you answer all these questions, you will start to get a better idea of your world and/or the main characters. Then you can refer to the suggestions above to flesh things out!</p>
